### Project: Teacher's Pet

# 

Teacher’s Pet is a desktop application for managing contacts of students and classes, optimised for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, Teacher’s Pet can get your contact and class management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.
